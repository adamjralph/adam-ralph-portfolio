# Project overview

This site was originally built as a learning project while I was working through [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp).
Since in that program I was learning a lot of **mongoose** ORM to work with **mongodb**, I decided to try out the **nodejs** driver provided by mongodb. This was challenging, but rewarding.

# Tech stack and build

<br>

For the original project I used the following:
<br><br>

> -   ejs
> -   CSS
> -   JavaScript
> -   nodejs
> -   express
> -   mongodb

<br>

Later on I when I wanted to deploy the site the the web I realized I had built it in a way that would be very difficult to deploy to the web without a major refactoring. I decided to do just that and have begun to rebuild it using [Astro](http://astro.build) and that is now deployed to the web at: [blocklink.netlify.app](http://blocklink.netlify.app)

# Dificulties encountered

<br>

This project was very challenging in many respects.
<br><br>

# Learning

<br>

I wanted this project to help me get better at CSS and particularly
Sass. As a result I was able to learn how to set up partials in folders
and how to use _index.scss_ files to forward partials to where they were
needed then use _@use_ in each file to namespace the statements I needed.
This was very rewarding and I have used and refined this method in other
projects since. I also learned the _BEM_ methodology for naming CSS
classes.

<br>

# Future plans

<br>

As this will be my future agency/freelance site I expect to spend time
refining it and experimenting with different design adjustments as I
have to time to make something I am really happy with. I would like to
refine the CSS to make it more logical and maintainable. I would also
like to have some animations on scroll to bring the site alive a bit
more, but not too much, this site is all about making a big impact while
remaining as understated as possible.
